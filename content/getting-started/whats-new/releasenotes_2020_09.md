ResInsight supports import of [ 3D Surfaces ]({{< relref "3d-main-window/surfaces" >}}), and allows mapping properties and simulation results onto these surfaces.

## Color Management

User defined color legends are now supported. 

TODO : Add link to color legend doc

## Analysis Plots

[ Analysis Plots ]({{< relref "plot-window/analysisplots" >}}) are bar charts used to compare summary data at specific timesteps across *Ensembles* and *Summary Cases*.

## Correlation Plots

[ Correlation Plots ]({{< relref "plot-window/correlationplots" >}}) are plots used to visualize correlations between ensemble parameters and summary result vectors.
Several visualizations can be created, including tornado plots, correlation matrices, and cross plots.

## Derived Geomechanical Results
