ResInsight has a [gRPC Remote Procedure Call](https://www.grpc.io/) interface with a Python Client interface. This interface allows you to interact with a running ResInsight instance from a Python script. The Python client package is compatible with **Python 3**.

The Python client package is available for install via the Python PIP package system with `pip install rips` as admin user, or `pip install --user rips` as a regular user.

On some systems the `pip` command may have to be replaced by `python -m pip`.
