ResInsight is able to import Eclipse cases in the form of 
_`*.GRID`_ and _`*.EGRID`_ files along with their _`*.INIT`_ and restart files _`*.XNNN`_ and _`*.UNRST`_. 
ResInsight also supports selected parts of Eclipse input files and can read grid 
information and corresponding cell property data sets from _`*.GRDECL`_ files. 
For functionality and import of Eclipse data pertinent to summary vectors and well log data, see [Plot Window]({{< ref "..\plot-window\_index.md" >}}).

ResInsight can be built with support for geomechanical models from ABAQUS and is also able to import 
transient reservoir souring data from the simulation software SourSimRL.

Furthermore, ResInsight supports import of property tables in ABQUS input file format, 
import of observed time history data, and pasting time history data into a summary plot
as described in the subsequent subchapters.
