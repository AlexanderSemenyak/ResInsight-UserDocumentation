ResInsight provides powerful and flexible mechanisms for post-processing of results and automation by its scripting interfaces:

- Command line interface and Command files
- Python interface
- Octave interface


## Python Interface
ResInsight offers a [Python Interface] ({{< relref "PythonRips.md" >}})
which allows you to interact with a running ResInsight instance from a Python script. 
This allows using the powerful Python language, numerical libraries, and other support modules in conjunction with ResInsight. The Python client package is compatible with **Python 3**.

For examples on how to use Python, see [Examples]({{< relref "pythonexamples.md" >}})
