This is the main window of ResInsight for 2D graphing and plotting. As seen, the **Plot Main Window** has a central area 
and two docking windows surrounding it. The docking windows cover the following:

- **Plot Project Tree** -- contains all application objects in a tree structure.
- **Property Editor** -- displays all properties for the selected object in the **Project Tree**

A selected subset of actions are presented as controls in the toolbar. 
The following subchapters describe the functionality, graphs, and plots of the **Plot Main Window**.
